                    <p class="text-gray-600">Spoke to Roxi about transferring to a busier location for financial stability. Roxi countered by offering the Lead Server position at Yellowhawk, praising my work and promising a pay increase. I accepted the offer.</p>

                                <p class="mt-2 text-sky-700">I believe Roxi offered me this promotion of convenience for her. She had recently been promoted herself and told me explicitly that I would be taking over some of her former duties. My assessment is that she needed someone to handle her less desirable tasks and dangled the promotion as an incentive, without any genuine intention of formalizing the position or the pay raise.</p>

The position never materialized for him either, and he eventually left the company due to that.</p>

                    <p class="text-gray-600">Took on numerous managerial duties (tours, PIN access, reports, opening/closing) while repeatedly inquiring about the formal promotion. Was consistently told it was "in the works".</p>

                    <p class="text-gray-600">After an unrelated discussion about a damaged crib I returned to her, I again asked Roxi about the position. She stated, “Cooper and I weren’t sure if you still wanted the position due to your pregnancy.” She then inquired about my due date, suggesting the timing would be an issue as she needed someone consistent. I was stunned into silence and left the conversation distressed.</p>

                    <p class="text-gray-600">After I pushed for a proper investigation, a formal meeting was set. On May 23, I met with Roxi and two HR reps. They denied my request to record but assured me they would take notes. In the meeting, Roxi denied making the pregnancy comment. Instead, she claimed she only remembered congratulating me and offering a crib for the new baby. This story was impossible, as I had already bought and returned her crib months earlier, and she had texted her congratulations back in December. I pointed out these inconsistencies in her story, as well as in Cooper's, who went from denying any knowledge of the promotion to later blaming his forgetfulness. I urged them to check the tasting room's surveillance footage and offered to show them Cooper's contradictory texts. I also asked if it was possible to at least get a raise. </p>

                                <p class="text-gray-600">Roxy mentioned should would inquire about the surveillance (she never did) and a pay raise for me (not promotion)(she never did)</p>

                    <p class="text-gray-600">Something else noteworthy thing is I asked Roxi if anyone ever held the Lead Server position before me. No one had. It seems the position isn't official and no one has ever held that title.</p>

I just wanted to say that I certainly do and despite my pregnancy will continue to work :)</p><p class="mt-2">I mentioned it to Roxy, and she replied that she needed to check in on the responsibilities/timeline.

        <div class="mt-2">
            <p>Dear Cooper and Roxi,</p>
            <p>I hope you're both doing well. I have a few questions regarding my pay and status that I'd appreciate clarification on.</p>
            <p><strong>Pay Questions:</strong></p>
            <ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-1">
              <li>Can you clarify why my pay was reduced and why I wasn't given prior notice?</li>
              <li>Who decided I deserved to have a pay reduction, and why?</li>
              <li>Why was my previous sick pay lower than minimum wage?</li>
            </ol>
            <p class="mt-2"><strong>Promotion/Pay Raise Questions (for Roxy):</strong></p>
            <ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-1">
              <li>Did my pregnancy factor into the changes regarding my promotion?</li>
              <li>Why was I told that you were discussing my promotion & pay raise with Cooper for months?</li>
              <li>Why was I informed that there was uncertainty between you and Cooper about whether I wanted the promotion due to my pregnancy?</li>
              <li>Why was Cooper unaware of these discussions when I reached out?</li>
              <li>When I asked you about the delay in the decision after being denied, I was told that "these things take time" - but after reaching out to Cooper, I received a definitive answer within two weeks. Could you clarify this discrepancy? What took months to figure out? And with whom were you discussing this with, if not with Cooper?</li>
            </ol>
            <p class="mt-2">I feel misled and strung along. I was encouraged to stay at Yellowhawk during the slow season with the understanding that I would receive a promotion and pay raise. I was trained for the role and engaged in discussions about it for months. However, the decision seemed to shift suddenly, and I was told that my pregnancy might impact whether I wanted the role-despite my consistent interest. This has been confusing, and I'd appreciate a clearer understanding of what happened.</p>
            <p>Honestly I decided to let it go, even though I felt deceived. But seeing my pay reduction is a little much...Truly, I feel I need an actual explanation.</p>
            <p>Thank you for your time. I look forward to your response.</p>
            <p>Best,<br>Arianne Brauer</p>

            <p>Arianne,</p>
            <p>Here are the answers to your questions...wrote in all caps under each question to read easier (it isn't shoutingL:)!)</p>
            <p><strong>Pay Questions:</strong></p>
            <ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-2">
                <li><strong>Can you clarify why my pay was reduced and why I wasn't given prior notice?</strong><br>OWNERSHIP HEARD ABOUT THE SERVICE CHARGE ISSUES WITH GUESTS AND SINCE WE ARE NOT SERVING A FULL FOOD MENU, THEY DECIDED TO MOVE BACK TO A NORMAL TIP MODEL. ROXY DISCUSSED WITH YOU AND THE TEAM (ROXY CAN EXPAND ON THAT) AS YOU CAN SEE IN #2, YOUR PAY INCREASED WHEN YOU MOVED OFF OF THE COMMISSION MODEL TO THE REGULAR TIP MODEL. NOT SEEING A PAY DECREASE.</li>
                <li><strong>Who decided I deserved to have a pay reduction, and why?</strong><br>AGAIN, THE DATA DOES NOT SHOW A PAY DECREASE. OWNERSHIP DECEIDED TO MOVE OFF OF COMMISSION MODEL AND BACK TO THE REGULAR TIP MODEL. THIS STARTED WITH THE FEB 28TH PAYCHECK. YOUR AVG HOURLY RATE WAS $27.00 PER HOUR. THE PREVIOUS TWO CHECKS (UNDER COMMISSION MODEL) AVG HOURLY RATE FEB 14TH WAS $18.43 AND JANUARY 17TH WAS $20.70.</li>
                <li><strong>Why was my previous sick pay lower than minimum wage?</strong><br>3/14 PAYROLL CHECK WAS INACCURATE... YOU WERE SHORTED BY $26.06 AFTER LYNN (NEW YH BOOKKEEPER) FOUND THE ERROR. THAT WILL BE ADDED TO YOUR NEXT CHECK! SEE ABOVE...IT WAS AN SYSTEM ERROR THAT HAS BEEN FIXED AND WILL BE PAID ON NEXT PAYCHECK</li>
            </ol>
            <p class="mt-2"><strong>Promotion/Pay Raise Questions (for Roxy):</strong></p>
            <ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-2">
                <li><strong>Did my pregnancy factor into the changes regarding my promotion?</strong><br>NOT AT ALL. WE ARE DOING LIMITED REVENUE THIS TIME OF THE YEAR AND HAVE NO NEED FOR A LEAD SERVER AT THIS TIME.</li>
                <li><strong>Why was I told that you were discussing my promotion & pay raise with Cooper for months?</strong><br>ROXY MENTIONED TO ME THAT THERE WAS INTEREST FROM A TEAMMEMBER...AND WE SAID WE ARE NOT DOING ANYTHING UNTIL SALES INCREASE AND WE MOVE INTO THE BUSIER SEASON AT YH. ROXY DISCUSSED WITH YOU IN FEBRUARY ABOUT THE LEAD POSITION BUT TOLD YOU UNTIL BUSINESS PICKS UP, IT WOULDN'T HAPPEN...AND MAY SEEMS TO MAKE THE MOST SENSE AS THAT IS WHEN WE WILL BEGIN TO HIRE AND ONBOARD THE NEW TEAM MEMBERS</li>
                <li><strong>Why was I informed that there was uncertainty between you and Cooper about whether I wanted the promotion due to my pregnancy?</strong><br>YOUR PREGANCY WAS NEVER A CONSIDERATION AND ROXY AND I NEVER DISCUSSED THAT. I ONLY FOUND OUT YOU WERE PREGNANT WHEN YOU TEXTED ME ON FEB 14TH ABOUT THE LEAD SERVER QUESTIONS.</li>
                <li><strong>Why was Cooper unaware of these discussions when I reached out?</strong><br>I WASN'T CLEAR. WE HAD DISCUSSED A LEAD SERVER BUT DON'T DIDN'T REMEMBER IT SPECIFIC TO YOU...MORE CONFUSION ON MY END AS I DIDN'T REMEMBER US DISCUSSING SOMEONE SPECIFICALLY, JUST A "LEAD SERVER". WHICH AGAIN, WE DONT NEED AS THERE IS VERY LITTLE REVENUE (OR TRAINING) THAT NEEDS TO TAKE PLACE.</li>
                <li><strong>When I asked you about the delay in the decision after being denied, I was told that "these things take time" - but after reaching out to Cooper, I received a definitive answer within two weeks. Could you clarify this discrepancy? What took months to figure out? And with whom were you discussing this with, if not with Cooper?</strong><br>ROXY CONTIUNED TO TELL YOU WE DO NOT HAVE THE BUSINESS LEVELS TO SUPPORT ADDING A LEAD SERVER AND THE GOAL FOR HIRING FOR THAT POSITION WAS GOING TO BE WHEN BUSINESS LEVEL INCREASE AND HIRING AND ONBOARDING START IN MAY.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>I'm forwarding the message I sent that day</p>
            <p>I suppose I'm confused at my base pay rate going from 17.00 an hour down to the absolute minimum 16.66. As shown in attached images. Am I understanding this wrong? I'm not referring to my average pay which is determined by my tips/etc - I'm talking about my actual pay rate. Someone made the choice to reduce it. I'm so glad to hear the new bookkeeper caught the sick leave! One other thing I wanted to confirm with you is the 'tip make-up' line item on paychecks. I was told by the wonderful new bookkeeper that this represents tips that were missed and later accounted for. Just wanted to double-check for clarity-thank you!</p>

            <p><em>One thing to note is that on PP05 they dropped her from $17.00 to $16.66 and I did not catch that. For her total pay we would owe her an additional $9.46. I reached out to AMP for this to be corrected</em></p>

            <p>Oops! I now know how to reply to all. I thought it was happening the whole time.</p>
            <p>Thanks for your help! Just to confirm, it sounds like it was an error that my pay rate dropped to 16.66, and it will be corrected back to 17.00-do I have that right? I may have also missed your response to this part: just to confirm-'tip make up' is the amount management/bookkeeping adds to my paycheck to account for missed tips, correct? Apologies for all the questions-I just want to ensure I have a crystal-clear understanding, especially since there seem to be some discrepancies that need addressing. I really appreciate your time and clarification!</p>

            <p>Yes...what was missed is being caught up on this payroll. Switch over from the old bookkeeper to Lynn wasn't the smoothiest but Lynn has got us all dialed in now and has our systems in place.</p>

            <p>I don't believe that is. I have added Lynn to the thread to explain what "tip make up" means on your paystub and how the back pay is recorded on this Friday's check (Lynn, would it be listed as "retro"?

            <p>Awesome thanks! Lynn replied/confirmed twice about this - I just wanted to be 100% sure that 'tip make up' were my tips that were 'missed' and then later added to my paycheck--referring to my previous paychecks prior to the changes-- again just for complete clarity. I'm not being obtuse on purpose I promise!! But Since you're deferring to Lynn I believe that answers everything for now. I'll take her previous answers as correct and I now fully understand. If she wants to clarify further, that's totally fine, but I think I've got it :)</p>

            <p>Yes as stated before tip make up are tips that were missed previously/tips that were added through the workbook. This payroll you will have additional money added to your check and this is from the sick pay that was not paid out at minimum wage. Feel free to always ask questions. It's your money!</p>

            <p>Hi all,</p>
            <p>I was reviewing my most recent pay stub and noticed that Wine Bottle Sales are listed at $0. This is clearly an error, and it's not the first one I've encountered as has been clearly demonstrated. I would like to be paid the full amount that I earned. Paystub before this one seemingly has me shorted $5 in tips, according to my records. Is there any way this can be confirmed and rectified? Lastly, Cooper - I reached out to Darcy twice separately via email, but I've received no reply. I checked to make sure I got the right email but maybe this chain will work.</p>
            <p>Thank you,<br>Arianne Brauer</p>

            <p>Thank you for reaching out, Wendi.</p>
            <p>As I understand the situation: I was offered the lead server position but was misled about it for several months. This ultimately culminated in Roxi telling me the role was "potentially" no longer available due to my pregnancy-based on an assumption that I might not want the position anymore.</p>
            <p>When I brought this concern to Cooper, I learned there had been no discussions or decisions regarding the role at all, despite being told repeatedly that Roxi was in active conversations with him about it.</p>
            <p>After escalating my concerns to both Cooper and HR, it appears Darcey deferred entirely to Cooper, whose only action was to ask Roxi if she had mentioned my pregnancy. Roxi denied it, and that was treated as the full extent of the inquiry. As for being misled over the course of several months, that issue seems to have been completely disregarded. Cooper simply stated that the position was never and is currently not available directly contradicting everything Roxi had told me.</p>
            <p>At a minimum, I expected HR to conduct a basic, good-faith investigation. What I experienced instead felt cursory at best and dismissive.</p>
            <p>I would appreciate clarification on what was actually discussed between Cooper and Darcey, and whether Darcey ever spoke directly with Roxi. From my perspective, it seems Cooper assured Darcey that everything was fine, and the matter was dropped. She said she would be glad to speak with me but I received no further replies until she left the position.</p>

            <p>Hey Aleigh and Karen,</p>
            <p>This is Arianne Brauer. Apologies for the delay. Since I wasn't able to record the HR meeting, I was wondering if I could have copies of your notes?</p>
            <p>Also, here are my screenshots I said I'd provide of Cooper not knowing what I was talking about, nor did he know about my pregnancy. Keep in mind, during the meeting, Roxi stated that her and Cooper did have a few conversations about the lead server position. If that is the case, then his response to my text doesn't make sense.</p>

            <p>We received your message and request for notes from our meeting with you and Roxy on 5/23/25. These notes are considered internal documentation and we do not share them.</p>
            <p>As Roxy and Cooper have stated, a new server position would be dependent on business need. There is not a business need for a new server position at Yellowhawk at this time.</p>

            <p>All your documentation is internal, so does that mean I’m entitled to no information at all?</p>
            <p>I’m requesting all relevant documentation I’m entitled to regarding my discrimination case, including details on who is/was assigned to my case, what actions have been taken, who was interviewed, and what was investigated - including timelines.</p>
            <p>You ladies denied me the ability to record our discussion, despite explaining it was to aid my memory, as I couldn’t take notes while fully engaging in the conversation as you were. This puts me at a huge disadvantage, so please provide any relevant notes, summaries, or records from those meetings to ensure transparency.</p>
            <p>Lastly, to clarify, the screenshots I provided were not a request for a position but evidence to show that someone is being dishonest, and it’s not me. While it seems no action will be taken on this, I insist on receiving all documentation I'm entitled to regarding my case.</p>
            <p>Please send these materials promptly.</p>

            <p>Thank you for providing the notes I originally requested.</p>
            <p>Why was I initially denied these notes regarding my case, citing it as "internal", especially after being refused the ability to record for my memory? Furthermore, explain why it was denied to me, but now is being forwarded to Roxy? (To be clear, I am 100% okay with Roxy receiving the notes, I am not okay that I was denied them, had to push back for them, and then they're sent to another person that didn't even request them) - I'm trying to understand the policies that govern information access to ensure they are applied equitably.</p>
            <p>Please send the other information I've asked for in my previous email as I'm compiling information regarding this - for no other reason than I like to have everything 100% complete, organized, and accounted for, again, for my memory. Call it a quirk.</p>
            <p>Finally, I'd like HRT Northwest policy on the handling of discrimination complaints. Basically, what is the playbook over there at HRT Northwest when a discrimination complaint is received?</p>
            <p>Thanks so much ladies.</p>

            <p>We want to address your ongoing requests for internal investigation procedures, the names of individuals involved in the review, and access to internal notes.

Any internal documents we may have are not shared as part of our standard practice. We will not be making an exception here.</p>
            <p>Regarding the short summary that was provided to you after your initial request for investigation notes: while we originally informed you that investigation notes would not be shared, we decided to create and share a brief summary of the conversation in which you were personally involved, in good faith and with the intent to be transparent and supportive. This was not a reversal of our position, but rather an attempt to provide clarity on a limited and relevant point.</p>
            <p>As the case is now closed, unless you have new and relevant information to provide, we will not be engaging in further correspondence on this matter.</p>
            <p>Thank you for your attention to this.</p>

        <div class="mt-2">
            <p>Dear Cooper,</p>
            <p>I'm deeply concerned that my discrimination case related to my pregnancy, has not been investigated. I am being refused information regarding my case, and was told I would receive no further responses whatsoever. They didn't answer a single question. Would you be able to determine whether any investigation happened, and if so, what steps were taken? I realize nothing will be done; as of right now I'm trying to determine whether an investigation ever even occurred.</p>
            <p>Roxy informed me that she wants to discuss a matter in person tomorrow, requiring me to arrive an hour early. Despite my repeated requests for details and my preference for email communication to keep everything documented - due to prior issues with her - she refused. When I directly asked why this had to be inperson, off the record, and early, she admitted it's an HR meeting. There's no justifiable reason for her to withhold this information or be evasive. She could have simply stated it was an HR meeting from the start. Her actions suggest an intentional attempt to catch me off guard, as there's no valid reason to conceal a scheduled HR meeting.</p>
            <p>P.S. I am still in the process of determining just how much money was withheld from me over the years. I have confirmed to have been withheld hundreds as of now - potentially thousands of dollars over the years in multiple ways, on multiple fronts: Tips withheld, bottle sales withheld, incorrect minimum wage, having my wage reduced, even incorrect sick pay. I have had wages withheld in every way feasible other than direct theft. How is this possible? I have received no valid reason for having this many wage issues, no explanation, absolutely nothing. Only delays and reimbursements. I'm still waiting on reimbursements on confirmed amounts. I'm also still waiting for a response from the Bookkeeper regarding all of this - she is currently investigating and preparing to send me the reports by scanning them, so I'm very grateful!</p>
            <p>Thanks much</p>

      <h3 class="font-bold">Summary of Meeting with Arianne Brauer, Roxy Spence, Yellowhawk on 5/23/25</h3>
      <p class="text-xs italic">by Karen Rylander and Aleigh Smith, HRT</p>
      
      <p>Arianne believes that she was offered a lead server job, and that Cooper approved it. Arianne was excited at feeling valued and potentially getting more pay. She repeatedly asked Roxy when it would happen. Roxy said there was never an offer for an actual date; she was also excited about the prospect, but the business has not been able to support hiring another person.</p>
      
      <p>Arianne believes that Roxy asked her if she still wanted the lead server job, because of Arianne's pregnancy. Roxy apologized for that misunderstanding. She remembers congratulating Arianne but does not believe or remember asking if Arianne's pregnancy would affect her interest in the job.</p>
      
      <p>Arianne emailed Cooper to say her pregnancy would not affect her being lead server. According to Arianne, Cooper responded that he did not know Arianne was interested, or that she was pregnant.</p>
      
      <p>Arianne is still disappointed for what she said was "being led to believe" she would be getting the lead server job before long. Roxy was apologetic for the apparent misunderstanding but reiterated that a new server position will not be added unless and until business picks up. They still have different recollections.</p>
      
      <p>Arianne said she has been struggling with pain when working but has not mentioned it to Roxy. Roxy said she tries to check in with Arianne and needs to know if Arianne is struggling, so Roxy can help. Arianne agreed to do so.</p>
      
      <p>Arianne is waiting for information for a commission on wine bottles she sold that apparently should have been paid. Roxy said the new bookkeeper will be working on it when she returns from a trip soon.</p>
      
      <p>Arianne also asked if there is any chance she could have a "bump" in her pay at this point, even if there's no lead server position available. Roxy had no answer, but agreed to bring it up with Cooper.</p>
      
      <p>Although there was not complete agreement on what happened, Arianne and Roxy both said they could amicably work together after this meeting.</p>

            <p>Hi Arianne,</p>
            <p>Regular hours are the hours you worked. This is how you will be getting paid moving forward. An hourly rate.</p>
            <p>Tip Make up is if any Tips were missed this is paid out to you at that time.</p>
            <p>Tips on check is how any tips from credit cards will be getting paid to you moving forward.</p>
            <p>Wine Club Commissions is not something that you will be receiving.</p>
            <p>WA L & I is Washington State Labor and Industries is workers compensation insurance.</p>
            <p>You also get wine bottle incentive so you get a dollar a bottle that you sell in the tasting room.</p>
            <p>I hope this helps clear things up!</p>

            <p>Tip Make Up: Could you elaborate further? What does missed tips mean?</p>
            <p>Also, I realize the line items have changed, however I still need to know the details of them, so I appreciate the response. Could you please go into detail on the 'Commission' line item as well - how it's calculated, where it's from etc?</p>

            <p>Sure.</p>
            <p>Tip Make up-for example if a server missed or rang in as a different amount for a tip on a credit card or cash, but it was caught by the manager or bookkeeper it gets added to the paycheck.</p>
            <p>Commission is based off the gross sales for the employee on that day. It was 15%. For example if you had $1000 in gross sales your commission for the day would be $150.00 plus whatever tips you got. Cash tips you get at the time and charged tips come on your paycheck.</p>
            <p>Is that a better explanation?</p>
            <p>Hope that clears it up!</p>

            <p>Yes, that clarifies things, thank you!</p>
            <p>Just one last question: How is 'gross sales' calculated? Is it 15% of the total bill paid by the table, or is it 15% of the service charge?</p>

            <p>No problem. It is based of the Gross Sales for the day. It is not the service charge.</p>

            <p>Dear Cooper and Roxi,</p>
            <p>I hope you're both doing well. I have a few questions regarding my pay and status that I'd appreciate clarification on.</p>
            <p><strong>Pay Questions:</strong></p>
            <ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-1">
              <li>Can you clarify why my pay was reduced and why I wasn't given prior notice?</li>
              <li>Who decided I deserved to have a pay reduction, and why?</li>
              <li>Why was my previous sick pay lower than minimum wage?</li>
            </ol>
            <p class="mt-2"><strong>Promotion/Pay Raise Questions (for Roxy):</strong></p>
            <ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-1">
              <li>Did my pregnancy factor into the changes regarding my promotion?</li>
              <li>Why was I told that you were discussing my promotion & pay raise with Cooper for months?</li>
              <li>Why was I informed that there was uncertainty between you and Cooper about whether I wanted the promotion due to my pregnancy?</li>
              <li>Why was Cooper unaware of these discussions when I reached out?</li>
              <li>When I asked you about the delay in the decision after being denied, I was told that "these things take time" - but after reaching out to Cooper, I received a definitive answer within two weeks. Could you clarify this discrepancy? What took months to figure out? And with whom were you discussing this with, if not with Cooper?</li>
            </ol>
            <p class="mt-2">I feel misled and strung along. I was encouraged to stay at Yellowhawk during the slow season with the understanding that I would receive a promotion and pay raise. I was trained for the role and engaged in discussions about it for months. However, the decision seemed to shift suddenly, and I was told that my pregnancy might impact whether I wanted the role-despite my consistent interest. This has been confusing, and I'd appreciate a clearer understanding of what happened.</p>
            <p>Honestly I decided to let it go, even though I felt deceived. But seeing my pay reduction is a little much...Truly, I feel I need an actual explanation.</p>
            <p>Thank you for your time. I look forward to your response.</p>
            <p>Best,<br>Arianne Brauer</p>

            <p>Here are the answers to your questions...wrote in all caps under each question to read easier (it isn't shoutingL:)!)</p>
            <p><strong>Pay Questions:</strong></p>
            <ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-2">
                <li><strong>Can you clarify why my pay was reduced and why I wasn't given prior notice?</strong><br>OWNERSHIP HEARD ABOUT THE SERVICE CHARGE ISSUES WITH GUESTS AND SINCE WE ARE NOT SERVING A FULL FOOD MENU, THEY DECIDED TO MOVE BACK TO A NORMAL TIP MODEL. ROXY DISCUSSED WITH YOU AND THE TEAM (ROXY CAN EXPAND ON THAT) AS YOU CAN SEE IN #2, YOUR PAY INCREASED WHEN YOU MOVED OFF OF THE COMMISSION MODEL TO THE REGULAR TIP MODEL. NOT SEEING A PAY DECREASE.</li>
                <li><strong>Who decided I deserved to have a pay reduction, and why?</strong><br>AGAIN, THE DATA DOES NOT SHOW A PAY DECREASE. OWNERSHIP DECEIDED TO MOVE OFF OF COMMISSION MODEL AND BACK TO THE REGULAR TIP MODEL. THIS STARTED WITH THE FEB 28TH PAYCHECK. YOUR AVG HOURLY RATE WAS $27.00 PER HOUR. THE PREVIOUS TWO CHECKS (UNDER COMMISSION MODEL) AVG HOURLY RATE FEB 14TH WAS $18.43 AND JANUARY 17TH WAS $20.70.</li>
                <li><strong>Why was my previous sick pay lower than minimum wage?</strong><br>3/14 PAYROLL CHECK WAS INACCURATE... YOU WERE SHORTED BY $26.06 AFTER LYNN (NEW YH BOOKKEEPER) FOUND THE ERROR. THAT WILL BE ADDED TO YOUR NEXT CHECK! SEE ABOVE...IT WAS AN SYSTEM ERROR THAT HAS BEEN FIXED AND WILL BE PAID ON NEXT PAYCHECK</li>
            </ol>
            <p class="mt-2"><strong>Promotion/Pay Raise Questions (for Roxy):</strong></p>
            <ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-2">
                <li><strong>Did my pregnancy factor into the changes regarding my promotion?</strong><br>NOT AT ALL. WE ARE DOING LIMITED REVENUE THIS TIME OF THE YEAR AND HAVE NO NEED FOR A LEAD SERVER AT THIS TIME.</li>
                <li><strong>Why was I told that you were discussing my promotion & pay raise with Cooper for months?</strong><br>ROXY MENTIONED TO ME THAT THERE WAS INTEREST FROM A TEAMMEMBER...AND WE SAID WE ARE NOT DOING ANYTHING UNTIL SALES INCREASE AND WE MOVE INTO THE BUSIER SEASON AT YH. ROXY DISCUSSED WITH YOU IN FEBRUARY ABOUT THE LEAD POSITION BUT TOLD YOU UNTIL BUSINESS PICKS UP, IT WOULDN'T HAPPEN...AND MAY SEEMS TO MAKE THE MOST SENSE AS THAT IS WHEN WE WILL BEGIN TO HIRE AND ONBOARD THE NEW TEAM MEMBERS</li>
                <li><strong>Why was I informed that there was uncertainty between you and Cooper about whether I wanted the promotion due to my pregnancy?</strong><br>YOUR PREGANCY WAS NEVER A CONSIDERATION AND ROXY AND I NEVER DISCUSSED THAT. I ONLY FOUND OUT YOU WERE PREGNANT WHEN YOU TEXTED ME ON FEB 14TH ABOUT THE LEAD SERVER QUESTIONS.</li>
                <li><strong>Why was Cooper unaware of these discussions when I reached out?</strong><br>I WASN'T CLEAR. WE HAD DISCUSSED A LEAD SERVER BUT DON'T DIDN'T REMEMBER IT SPECIFIC TO YOU...MORE CONFUSION ON MY END AS I DIDN'T REMEMBER US DISCUSSING SOMEONE SPECIFICALLY, JUST A "LEAD SERVER". WHICH AGAIN, WE DONT NEED AS THERE IS VERY LITTLE REVENUE (OR TRAINING) THAT NEEDS TO TAKE PLACE.</li>
                <li><strong>When I asked you about the delay in the decision after being denied, I was told that "these things take time" - but after reaching out to Cooper, I received a definitive answer within two weeks. Could you clarify this discrepancy? What took months to figure out? And with whom were you discussing this with, if not with Cooper?</strong><br>ROXY CONTIUNED TO TELL YOU WE DO NOT HAVE THE BUSINESS LEVELS TO SUPPORT ADDING A LEAD SERVER AND THE GOAL FOR HIRING FOR THAT POSITION WAS GOING TO BE WHEN BUSINESS LEVEL INCREASE AND HIRING AND ONBOARDING START IN MAY.</li>
            </ol>
            <p class="mt-2">Happy to discuss more if you have any additional questions and feel free to reach out anytime to myself, Roxy or HR (Darcey)!</p>

            <p>I'm forwarding the message I sent that day</p>
            <p>I suppose I'm confused at my base pay rate going from 17.00 an hour down to the absolute minimum 16.66. As shown in attached images. Am I understanding this wrong? I'm not referring to my average pay which is determined by my tips/etc - I'm talking about my actual pay rate. Someone made the choice to reduce it. I'm so glad to hear the new bookkeeper caught the sick leave! One other thing I wanted to confirm with you is the 'tip make-up' line item on paychecks. I was told by the wonderful new bookkeeper that this represents tips that were missed and later accounted for. Just wanted to double-check for clarity-thank you!</p>

            <p>Thanks for your help! Just to confirm, it sounds like it was an error that my pay rate dropped to 16.66, and it will be corrected back to 17.00-do I have that right?

            <p>Awesome thanks! Lynn replied/confirmed twice about this - I just wanted to be 100% sure that 'tip make up' were my tips that were 'missed' and then later added to my paycheck--referring to my previous paychecks prior to the changes-- again just for complete clarity. I'm not being obtuse on purpose I promise!! But Since you're deferring to Lynn I believe that answers everything for now. I'll take her previous answers as correct and I now fully understand. If she wants to clarify further, that's totally fine, but I think I've got it :)</p>

            <p>Yes as stated before tip make up are tips that were missed previously/tips that were added through the workbook. This payroll you will have additional money added to your check and this is from the sick pay that was not paid out at minimum wage. Feel free to always ask questions. It's your money!</p>

            <p>Hi all,</p>
            <p>I was reviewing my most recent pay stub and noticed that Wine Bottle Sales are listed at $0. This is clearly an error, and it's not the first one I've encountered as has been clearly demonstrated. I would like to be paid the full amount that I earned. Paystub before this one seemingly has me shorted $5 in tips, according to my records. Is there any way this can be confirmed and rectified? Lastly, Cooper - I reached out to Darcy twice separately via email, but I've received no reply. I checked to make sure I got the right email but maybe this chain will work.</p>

            <p>Hi Roxy,</p>
            <p>Thank you for letting me know about the pay concern from Arianne. I did some calculations, and it looks like her check was shorted $32.10. I am working with AMP to get this sorted out and have asked for a payment amount (after taxes) to write a a check to make up the difference.</p>
            <p>I have started a spreadsheet to better track charged tips, bottle sales, and wages to be sure we catch this prior to payroll processing.</p>
            <p>Please let Arianne know that I apologize for the error and will work to correct it moving forward.</p>

            <p>Hey Suzie,</p>
            <p>I'm not sure how you calculated $32.10 as my shortage for the last pay period (4/21 - 5/04). Based on my calculations, I'm owed $56 for my tips. This is factoring in Spring Release saturday when the tips were split 3 ways. There's no concerns on bottle sales for this mentioned pay period.</p>
            <p>The pay period of 4/7 to 4/20, I was given no bottle sales, when I sold 67 bottles that pay period.</p>
            <p>I hope you're able to find these issues.</p>
            <p>Thank you for your time</p>

              <p>Yes, I do have the daily reports. I see that the Order Port tips did not get recorded correctly either. Thank you for your patience as we sorted this out. I will let AMP know about the Difference of $70.06 and have them calculate what you are owed. I will write a check as soon as I know the total. Hopefully I can have a check for you this weekend.</p>

              <p>Thank you for the update. I want to express my growing concern, as since I began closely reviewing my paystubs, I've uncovered several errors that required reimbursement. This naturally raises the question of how long these discrepancies may have been occurring without notice.</p>
              <p>Specifically, I'd like clarification on how the tips are not being recorded correctly, and how the paystub software failed to align with the spreadsheet/report. It's pretty scary to find multiple points of error on a single paycheck especially given that I've already identified wage withholding issues totaling hundreds of dollars over just the past ~four months. It's likely this has been happening even prior to my detailed tracking.</p>
              <p>To better understand and resolve this, would it be possible for you to provide the end-of-day reports/receipts I personally review and use to record my bottle sales? I'd like to cross-reference these with my paychecks to ensure accuracy. If there are additional instances of incorrect or missing compensation, I believe I have the right to fully investigate and address the matter.</p>
              <p>Thank you again for your time and attention to this issue.</p>

            <p>Good morning Arianne,</p>
            <p>I am sorry this is taking so long. I am auditing your pay starting 12/30/24 when the new fiscal year started. It is taking some time, but I am finding a few minor discrepancies.</p>
            <p>I am hoping to finish cross checking all reports in the next week. I would like to process through all pay periods so that we can make one adjustment. I will scan copies of your reports as I go and then send them at one time. I was out of town when the last payroll was processed, but I did notice a discrepancy. I apologize for that.</p>
            <p>I have created a spreadsheet to track all tips, bottle sales and hours worked so that I can cross check what is being reported in Toast and what is being submitted by you. I am hoping this will resolve any future issues. Again this is an extra step but hopefully will resolve the issue.</p>
            <p>We appreciate your patience as we try to rectify the issue.</p>

        <div class="mt-2">
            <p>Thank you so much! I eagerly await the reports you send so I may cross reference as well.</p>
            <p>I ask for urgency and priority on sending me those reports - I'll have the numbers quickly myself; I no longer wish to wait for delays. Additionally, I must insist on obtaining reports from as far back as possible. Presumably records are kept for a certain minimum. I hope you understand because if I've found this many errors, and you yourself are finding even more, then it stands to reason this has been an ongoing issue for as long as I've been working there and I want to be sure. Going back merely to the beginning of the fiscal year simply isn't enough of an audit.</p>
            <p>May I ask is there any other employee having issues like this or is it just me? I'm guessing others aren't keeping track like me - which means likely they're having wages withheld as well.</p>
            <p>Also, how is this happening? Is someone not inputting numbers correctly on multiple fronts? Is there a severe software issue? In which case this is a serious matter (it already is) affecting everyone warranting further and immediate investigation and resolution. Have you determined the cause of these accounting errors? For example, if you noticed a discrepancy just recently, did you discover the cause? Surely it can't be 'we're transitioning' which is the only reply I've received for months now as to why this is happening.</p>
            <p>Finally, random question: is there any budget for a family meal here at Yellow Hawk?</p>
            <p>To recap:</p>
            <ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-1">
                <li>Please prioritize sending me reports from as far back as you're able - presumably records are kept for a minimum of multiple years.</li>
                <li>Is anyone else having issues like me?</li>
                <li>How is this happening, what is the cause?</li>
                <li>Does Yellow Hawk offer servers a family meal?</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Thank you again, and apologies for being a pain! It's definitely concerning to realize that I would have never known and would be out hundreds - potentially thousands of dollars if I had never bothered to keep track after noticing multiple issues.</p>

            <p>Good morning Arianne,</p>
            <p>Here are copies of the server reports you requested. I have also included a copy of your Time Entry Report from Toast.</p>
            <p>We have cross-referenced with our payroll department to ensure accuracy. Since the start of 2025, there have been some pay adjustments to correct the situation. However, after further review, we have found additional errors on your checks. We owe you missed pay of $289.67. We are adding an additional $100 to that amount as compensation for our error.</p>
            <p>We have taken steps to ensure accuracy for our servers moving forward. We appreciate your patience as we verified all of our data to ensure that you are appropriately compensated for your work. We will have our payroll department prepare an updated earning report and issue a check to be mailed to you as soon as possible. I will email you when I put the check in the mail.</p>
            <p>Again, we apologize for our error and appreciate your patience as we work to correct it.</p>
            <p>If you have additional questions, please reach out to us.</p>
            <p>Thank you,<br>Susie Pearson<br>Bookkeeper<br>YELLOWHAWK RESORT<br>509-522-0200 x104</p>

            <p>Unfortunately that is the wrong address. I did tell Roxi, back in late January 2025, about my new address because I had concerns about my w-2 form. I guess it never got updated.</p>

            <p>When I tried to update my information before, it wouldn't let me so that's why I gave Roxi my new address in January.</p>
            <p>After reading your email, I tried again to update my address and it still wouldn't let me again. I attached a screenshot of what shows up when I try to update my address.</p>

        <div class="mt-2">
            <p>I'm going to reiterate my willingness to meet and discuss the 'issues' you have mentioned. However, the current arrangement for this meeting is causing me medically significant distress. This stress stems directly from being compelled to attend a meeting where I am not given any specific advanced information on the topics giving me no meaningful ability to prepare, denied the presence of a support person and witness reporting to me, and forbidden from making a recording to ensure accuracy.</p>
            <p>I am in the late stages of a pregnancy, my doctor has of course advised that avoiding intensely stressful situations is critical for my health and the health of my baby. The stress induced by the prospect of attending a closed door meeting with no witness accountable to me, or advanced information is not medically advisable for me at this time. Given these circumstances, attending an inperson meeting under the terms you have dictated is not a viable option.</p>
            <p>Therefore, as a necessary accommodation for my current medical condition, I request one of the following:</p>
            <ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-1">
                <li>We can conduct this discussion in writing via email. This format ensures complete clarity and accuracy for all parties and eliminates the one sided nature of the current arrangement being imposed on me.</li>
                <li>We can conduct this discussion via video conference, where I will be accompanied by my own witness.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>I'm ready and willing to cooperate fully once a safe and medically responsible format has been agreed upon. Please let me know which of these accommodations you can provide.</p>

            <p>Therefore, we will remove you from the schedule until we meet to discuss these issues. Additionally, we are not required to allow another witness at this meeting.</p>
            <p>Please let us know if you need to request a reasonable accommodation in order to perform the essential functions of your job. If that is the case, we can provide the necessary documentation for your doctor to certify the need. We would then engage in an interactive process with you to determine whether an accommodation is available.</p>

            <p>Arianne, I hope you are well. Since I haven't heard back from you in over a week, I am wondering: are you planning on returning to work at Yellowhawk?</p>
            <p>If so, please reply to this message by 6/25/25. I will then inform you of my availability for the performance discussion.</p>
            <p>If I do not hear from you by 6/25/25, we will consider you to have resigned from your employment with Yellowhawk effective your last day worked.</p>

            <p>Roxi,</p>
            <p>I want to be clear: I have not resigned, nor do I intend to. My current absence is due solely to the indefinite, unpaid suspension you imposed after I requested reasonable accommodations to have this meeting on the record.</p>
            <p>I remain willing to discuss any legitimate performance concerns. However, given HR's handling of my previous complaints, their unwillingness to answer questions or allow anything to be on the record -- and the manner in which this meeting was concealed from me -- I cannot participate in another closed-door, off-the-record meeting. Your refusal to allow a simple recording or a witness has forced me to carefully consider my position and explore all available options.</p>
            <p>Your ultimatum and deadline are noted.</p>
            <p>Sincerely,<br>Arianne Brauer</p>

            <p>Hey Tony,</p>
            <p>This is Arianne Brauer. I know I sent you a private message on Facebook a while ago about surveillance. How far back does the surveillance go? Also, does our cameras have audio to them? I was told you're in charge of that.</p>
            <p>Thank you also, if you're a father, have a good father's day weekend!</p>

            <p>Good morning,</p>
            <p>The cameras do not pick up audio and only save the last 30 days concurrently. The last day available would-be May 18, tomorrow would be May 19th, etc</p>
            <p>If the power glitches or goes out it resets and starts recording from that day until it catches up to 30 days, then starts over.</p>
            <p>Let me know if you have any more questions.</p>
